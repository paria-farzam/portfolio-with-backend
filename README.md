# portfolio-with-backend
This is a simple portfolio that uses MongoDB and has a back-end. The visitor can send messages to the admin via contact route and the admin can log in to messages route to view the messages. These messages and some resume information are stored in the database.
I know that my code may seem very beginner and non-standard. But keep in mind that this is my first experience in backend programming.
